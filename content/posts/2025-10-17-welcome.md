# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using the new Python static site generator!

## What This Generator Does

This static site generator converts Markdown files with YAML front matter into clean, responsive HTML. Key features include:

- Simple Markdown-to-HTML conversion
- YAML front matter for metadata
- Clean URL structure
- Tag-based organization
- Template inheritance with Jinja2

## Getting Started

To create a new post, simply:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `content/posts/` directory
1. Add YAML front matter at the top
1. Write your content in Markdown
1. Run the build process

That's it! The generator will handle the rest.

## Next Steps

I'm planning to add more features like:

- RSS feed generation
- Better styling
- Search functionality
- Comment integration

Stay tuned for updates!
